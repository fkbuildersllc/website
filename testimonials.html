											<h2>Testimonials</h2>
											<h3>Hear what our past clients have to say</h3>

										<p>Fred is a quality builder with a great deal of integrity. He did a very big project taking most of our house down to studs and rebuilding to final finish. He stopped by several times within the first few years after finishing the job to make sure we were satisfied

											Fred does quality work at a fair price. You can tell he takes pride in his work and is concerned with the customer's satisfaction. I had gotten a few estimates to replace the rail and repair the wood rot on my front deck. When Fred came out for the estimate, the thing that stood out to me was his attention to detail. He noticed and pointed out a few more things than the other contractors. His bid was in the middle of the other contractors, but I think it was a fair price and I felt the most confident in his work. Fred did an excellent job and I was very happy with the results! So much so, that I hired him to fix my back and side decks as well as paint my house. I definitely plan on going back to him for projects I'll have in the future.

											My kitchen was a nightmare. But then I met Fred Kreider. Now when I get up for a midnight snack, it feels like I'm still dreaming! Fred was not only timely and affordable, but his work was marvelous quality as well!

											Fred Kreider you are like an artist! when my wife and I came to you about building are dream bathroom we never thought that it could ever be as extravigant as you made it. You clearly know what your customers want and how to take there ideas and mesh them with the space saving designs you have and make things work flawlessly.
											We were amazed at the sudden accents you threw in like the italian marble around the his and hers sinks and how you made the shower look like it it was carved out of a hill in ireland somewhere!! The beautiful recessed lighting which I thought was the best because you could not see a single lightbulb but the glow from the lights was just perfect! Your mix of hardwood and different stones made us jump for joy. It looked so natural it was surreal. You are a man of your word and kept within budget and you and your crew cleaned up like you guys were never there! Thank you so much for our wonderful bathroom remodel. In the future you will probably be doing are kitchen if your not too busy!!!
